# Google Ads MCP: project index

Start at [prompt.md](prompt.md) for the enduring mission and accepted direction. This index locates the existing project contracts; it does not authorize historical operations.

## Mandatory context

Read applicable repository instructions, [working rules](docs/workflow/AGENTS.md), [current handoff](docs/workflow/HANDOFFS.md), [verification](docs/workflow/TESTING.md) and [knowledge bindings](docs/workflow/REFERENCES.md). Read the relevant source before changing it.

## Task routes

| Requested work | Owning contracts |
| --- | --- |
| Scope, requirements or priorities | [PRD](docs/workflow/PRD.md), [capabilities](docs/workflow/CAPABILITIES.md), [architecture](docs/workflow/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Component behavior or bug | [architecture](docs/workflow/ARCHITECTURE.md), [code style](docs/workflow/CODE_STYLE.md), [testing](docs/workflow/TESTING.md) |
| Interface or persistence | [API](docs/workflow/API.md), [database](docs/workflow/DATABASE.md), [security](docs/workflow/SECURITY.md) |
| Visible experience | [design](docs/workflow/DESIGN.md), [wireframes](docs/workflow/WIREFRAMES.md), [PRD](docs/workflow/PRD.md) |
| Configuration, operation or recovery | [security](docs/workflow/SECURITY.md), [secret locations](docs/workflow/SECRETS.md), [maintenance](docs/workflow/MAINTENANCE.md) |
| Resume or close a task | [handoff](docs/workflow/HANDOFFS.md), [report](docs/workflow/REPORT.md), [references](docs/workflow/REFERENCES.md) |

Combine all applicable routes; a security, data or release boundary adds its route even for a small UI edit. Non-applicable roles retain their stated reasons.
